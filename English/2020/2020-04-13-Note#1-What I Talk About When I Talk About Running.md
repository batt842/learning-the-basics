# What I Talk About When I Talk About Running

## Foreword
This might _come off_ sounding like a dodge, but this is a book about running, not a _treatise_ on how to be healthy.
- come off
  - (no match)
  - to succeed
  - to fall off
  - to become detached or removed
  - to stop taking medication or drug
- treatise /ˈtriːtɪs, -tɪz/
  - a formal book or article

Just a book in which I _ponder_ various things and _think out loud_.
- ponder something / ponder on/over/about
  - to spend time thinking carefully and seriously
- think out loud
  - to say/express one’s thought

No matter how _mundane_ some action might appear, _keep at it_ long enough and it becomes a _contemplative_, even meditative act.
- mundane /mʌnˈdeɪn/
  - ordinary, boring
  - concerned with ordinary daily life
- keep at it / keep it up
  - to continue to do something
- something keeps up
  - it continues
- contemplative
  - spending a lot of time thinking seriously and quietly

It just goes to show how _grueling_ an event a marathon really is.
- grueling
  - very difficult and tiring

Though I wouldn’t call any of this philosophy _per se_, this book does contain a certain amount of what might be _dubbed_ life lessons.
- per se /ˌpɜː ˈseɪ $ ˌpɜːr ˈsiː, -ˈseɪ, ˌper ˈseɪ/
  - used to say that something is being considered alone, not with other connected things
- dub
  - to give something or someone a name that describes them in some way
  - to change the original spoken language of a film (be dubbed into)

## One - Who's Going to Laugh at Mick Jagger?

I spend a lot of time in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and compared to Cambridge -so _muggy_ and hot with all its bricks and concrete it’s like a form of torture- summer in Hawaii is a _veritable_ paradise.
- muggy
  - unpleasantly warm and damp
- veritable
  - real, true (emphasizing)

How happy life is here, where we can enjoy _lounging_ around, reading a book in the shade of trees, or, if the _notion_ strikes us, go down, just as we are, for a _dip_ in the _inlet_.
- lounge
  - to stand, sit, and lie in a lazy or relaxed way
- lounge around
  - to spend time relaxing and doing nothing (syn. laze around)
- notion
  - an idea, belief, or opinion
- dip
  - a quick swim, a slight decrease in something, a sort of dipping sauce, …
- inlet
  - a narrow area of water that reaches from the sea or a lake into the land 

Sometimes I run fast when I feel like it, but if I increase the pace I shorten the amount of time I run, the point being to let the _exhilaration_ I feel at the end of each run _carry over_ to the next day.
- exhilaration
  - a feeling of being happy, excited, and full of energy
- carry (something) over
  - to continue something in the new situation or later
- carry-over (from)
  - something carried over

This is the same sort of _tack_ I find necessary when writing a novel.
- tack
  - a small nail with a sharp point and a flat top
  - a short pin with a large round flat top, for attaching notices on boards, walls, etc
  - the way you deal with a particular situation

To keep on going, you have to keep _up the rhythm_.

“Oh, I’ve got to do some errands!,” it _whisked_ itself away without so much as a _glance_ back.
- whisk
  - to mix liquid, eggs, etc very quickly so that air is mixed in it
  - to take someone or something away quickly from a place
- glance
  - glance at/up/down… to quickly look at someone or something
  - glance at/through… to read something quickly
  - n) a quick look

Nothing _abstruse_ or _ambivalent_ about it, not a speck of the metaphoric or the symbolic.
- abstruse /æbˈstruːs/
  - unnecessarily complicated and difficult to understand
- ambivalent /æmˈbɪvələnt/
  - not sure whether you want or like something or not
  - ambivalent about
  - ambivalent attitude/feeling

The energetic ones were _zipping down_ the road, _slicing through_ the air like they had robbers at their heels.
- zip through/past/along/down/…
  - to go somewhere or do something very quickly (syn. wizz, zoom, )
- slice through/into
  - to cut something easily
  - to move quickly and easily through something such as water or air

Their shoulders _slumped_ like this was the last thing in the world they wanted to be doing.
- slump
  - slump against/over/back/…: to fall or lean against something because you are not strong enough to stand
    - She slumped against the wall
  - to suddenly go down in value, price, or number (syn. soar)
  - (a shoulder or head slumps or is slumped) to bend forward because of unhappiness, tiredness, or unconsciousness

Their music is sort of _laid-back_ and never _pretentious_.
- laid-back
  - relaxed and seeming not to be worried about anything (opp. uptight)
- pretentious
  - trying to appear or sound more important or clever than you are

“It’s not bad, it’s sort of ordinary and doesn’t _amount to much_.”
- not amount to much/anything/a great deal
  - to not be important, valuable, or successful

As each of these memories _flits_ across my mind, I’m sure I unconsciously smile, or give a slight frown.
- flit
  - to move lightly or quickly and not stay in one place for very long

Sometimes when I think of life, I feel like a piece of _driftwood_ washed up on shore.
- driftwood
  - wood floating on the sea or left on the shore

As I run, the trade winds blowing in from the direction of the lighthouse _rustle_ the leaves of the eucalyptus over my head.
- rustle
  - if leaves, papers, clothes etc rustle, or if you rustle them, they make a noise as they rub against each other
  - to steal farm animals
- eucalyptus /ˌjuːkəˈlɪptəs/

I began living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the end of May of this year, and running has once again been the _mainstay_ of my daily routine ever since.

It would be better if I ran seven days, but I have to _factor in_ rainy days, and days when work keeps me busy.
- factor something in
  - to include some particular thing in your calculation

_Taking all this into_ account, I leave one day a week as a day off.
- take into account
  - to consider or remember something when judging a situation

In June I followed this plan exactly, running 156 miles _on the nose_.
- on the nose (A.E.)
  - exactly

First of all, my life has been getting busier, and free time is increasingly _at a premium_.
- be at a premium
  - getting rarer

The running part isn’t a problem for me, but in order to master _the other two legs of the event_ I had to devote a great deal of time to training in swimming and biking.

All of this took time and effort, and as a result I had less time to devote to running.

The thing is, I’m _not much for_ team sports.

And when it comes to martial arts, too, you can _count me out_.

World-class runners, of course, want to _outdo_ their closest rivals, but for your average, everyday runner, individual rivalry isn’t a major issue.
- outdo someone in something
  - to be better

I’m sure there are _garden-variety_ runners whose desire to beat a particular rival _spurs_ them on to train harder.
- garden-variety
  - very ordinary
- spur somebody (on) to do something / spur somebody (on) to something
  - to encourage
- spur
  - a fact or event that makes you try harder to do something

But what happens if their rival, for whatever reason, _drops out_ of the competition?

Most ordinary runners are motivated by an individual goal, more than anything: _namely_, a time thy want to beat.
- namely
  - to be specific / its name is … / their names are …

As long as he can beat that time, a runner will feel he’s accomplished what he _set out_ to do, and if he can’t then he’ll feel he hasn’t.
- set out for/on somewhere
  - to start a journey (syn. set off)
- set out to do something / set out with the idea/purpose/intention
  - to start doing something, making plans, setting goals, etc
- set something out
  - to explain, to arrange, …

Maybe numbers of copies sold, awards won, and critics’ praise serve as _outward_ standards for accomplishment in literature, but none of them really matter.
- outward
  - (only before noun) relating to how a person or situation seems to be, rather than how it really is

I’m at an ordinary- or perhaps more like _mediocre_- level.
- mediocre
  - not very good

There are individual differences, but for the most part swimmers hit that _watershed_ in their early twenties, boxers in their late twenties, and baseball players in their mid-thirties.
- watershed
  - turning point

Once I asked an _ophthalmologist_ if anyone’s ever avoided getting farsighted when they got older.
- ophthalmologist /ˌɑːfθælˈmɑːlədʒɪst/
  - an eye doctor

Things continued _at the stable plateau_ for a while, but before long they started to change.

But no matter how much I might deny it or try to ignore it, the numbers were _retreating_, step by step.
- retreat
  - to move away from the enemy after being defeated in battle (opp. advance)
  - move back / change one’s mind

Just running all the time couldn’t be good for me, I’d figured, deciding it would be better to add variety to my routine and develop a more all-around physical regimen.
- regimen /ˈredʒɪmɪn/
  - a special plan for food, exercise etc that is intended to improve your health (syn. regime)

A sense of disappointment _set in_ that all my hard work wasn’t paying off, that there was something _obstructing_ me, like a door that was usually open suddenly slammed in my face.
- set in
  - (something unpleasant) to begin and seem likely to continue
- obstruct
  - to block a road, passage etc
  - to prevent someone from doing something or something from happening

When I saw the Charles River again, a desire to run _swept over_ me.
- sweep over
  - (feeling) to affect 

The water soaks the shoreline, making the summer grasses grow thick, which help feed the _waterfowl_, and it flows _languidly_, _ceaselessly_, under the old bridges, reflecting clouds in summer and _bobbing_ with _floes_ in winter- and silently heads toward the ocean.
- waterfowl
  - a wild bird that swims and lives near water
- languid
  - moving slowly
- ceaseless
  - continuous
- bob
  - to move up and down when floating on the surface of water
  - to move quickly
  - to cut someone’s hair in a bob
- ice floe
  - an area of ice floating in the sea or river

Breathing in the crisp, _bracing_, early-morning air, I felt once again the joy of running on the familiar ground.
- (air or weather is) cold and fresh

The problem is, it’s also used by cyclists, so you have to watch out for speeding bikes _whizzing past_ from behind.
- whizz, whizz past, whizz through
  - to move very quickly

Sometimes when I run, I listen to jazz, but usually, it’s rock, since its beat is the best _accompaniment_ to the rhythm of running.
- accompaniment
  - music that is played in the background at the same time as another instrument or singer that plays or sings the main tune

In two and a half months I dropped about seven pounds, and the bit of _flab_ I was starting to see around my stomach disappeared.
- flab
  - soft loose flesh on a person’s body - used to show disapproval

I had mixed emotions about _carrying around_ that extra weight with me everyday.

But I discovered _to my delight_ that even these _indulgences_ can _be offset_ by persistent exercise.
- to someone’s delight
  - casing someone to be very happy
  - happily
- indulgence
  - the habit of allowing yourself to do or have whatever you want, or allowing someone else to do/have so
  - something you do or have for pleasure, not because you need it
  - willingness to ignore someone’s faults of weaknesses
  - a promise of freedom from punishment by God, sold by priests in Middle Age
- offset
  - if the cost or amount of something offsets another cost or amounts, the two things have an opposite effect so that the situation remains the same (syn. balance, cancel out, counteract, counterbalance, compensate, …)
  - or offset A against B

It might be a little silly for someone getting to be my age to _put this into words_, but I just want to make sure I _get the facts down_ clearly: I’m the kind of person who likes to be by himself.
- put something into words
  - to explain a feeling that you are having
- get the facts down?
- get down to the facts
  - to focus on the most important or truthful aspects of a particular situation
  - to begin to talk about things that matters

Gradually, then, though with _my own spin on it_, through personal experience I discovered how to be sociable.
- one’s own spin on it (usually in a form of ’to put someone’s (own) spin on it)
  - in this context, my own spin on it = my own interpretation of it

All I need to do is _gaze at_ the scenery passing by.
- gaze into/at/… 
  - to look at someone or something for a long time, giving it all your attention, often without realizing you are doing so
  - syn. stare at (usually with some kind of emotion)

What I mean is, the kinds of thoughts and ideas that invade my emotions as I run remain _subordinate_ to that void.
- suburdinate
  - less important
  - (someone is) in a less important position
    - Jekyll is subordinate to Hyde.

_Lacking content_, they are just random thoughts that gather around that central void.

The clouds are _mere_ guests in the sky that pass away and vanish, leaving behine the sky. The sky both exists and doesn't exist. It has substance and at the same time doesn't. And we _merely_ accept that vast expense and drink it in.

When I was young, I never imagined the twenty-first century would actually come and that, _all joking aside_, I'd turn fifty. In theory, of course, it was self-evident that someday, if nothing else happened, the twenty-first century would _roll around_ and I'd turn fifty.
- roll around
  - (a time, event etc) to happens again or regularly

As I mentioned before, competing against other people, whether in daily life or in my field of work, is just not the sort of lifestyle _I'm after_.
- be after something/someone
  - to chase someone, to pursue something

Especially for someone _in my line of work_, solitue is, more or less, an inevitable circumstance.

Sometimes, however, this sense of isolation, like acid spilling out of a bottle, can unconsciously _eat away at_ a person's heart and dissolve it.
- eat away at something/somebody
  - to gradually remove or reduce the amount of something
  - to make someone feel very worried over a long period of time

I think in my own way I'm aware of this danger- probably through experience- and that's why I've had to constantly keep my body in motion, in some cases pushing myself to the limit, in order to heal the loneliness I feel inside and to put it in perspective.
- put something in(to) perspective
  - to judge or compare something in a sensible way

When I'm criticized _unjustly_ (from my viewpoint, at least), or when someone who I'm sure will understand me doesn't, I go running for a little longer than usual. By running little longer it's like I can physically exhaust that portion of my _discontent_.
- discontent
  - unhappiness, dissatisfaction, ..

Who in the world could possibly have warm feelings, or something like them, for a person who doesn't compromise, _who instead_, whenever a problem _crops up_, locks himself away alone in a closet?
- crop up
  - (problems) to happens, arise or appear
  - (name or subject) to come up so you can read or hear

For me, at least, as I've written novels over many years, I just can't _picture_ someone liking me _on a personal level_.

I'll wait till later to think about what it all means. (Putting off thinking about something is one of my specialties, a skill I've _honed_ as I've grown older.)
- hone
  - to improve skills
  - to make knives, swords etc sharp (syn. sharpen)

With the trade winds _wafting_ against my face, a white _heron_ up above, its legs dutifully aligned as it crosses the sky, and me listening to my old favorite, the Lovin' Spoonful.
- waft, waft up/through/over/...
  - (smell, smoke, or a light wind) to move gently (syn. drift)
  - a sound can also waft
- heron /ˈherən/

But I'm not the type who operates through pure theory or logic, not the type whose energy source is intellectual _speculation_. Only when I'm given an actual physical burden and my muscles start to _groan_ (and sometimes scream) does my comprehension meter shoot upward and I'm finally able to grasp something.
- speculation
  - the activity of guessing without enough information
  - theory, belief, or guessing
- groan
  - to make a low deep sound probably because of unpleasant or enjoyment (syn. moan)
  - to complain about something
