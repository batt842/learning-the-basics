# What I Talk About When I Talk About Running

## Foreword
This might come off sounding like a dodge, but this is a book about running, not a treatise on how to be healthy.
- come off
  - (no match)
  - to succeed
  - to fall off
  - to become detached or removed
  - to stop taking medication or drug
- treatise /ˈtriːtɪs, -tɪz/
  - a formal book or article

Just a book in which I ponder various things and think out loud.
- ponder something / ponder on/over/about
  - to spend time thinking carefully and seriously
- think out loud
  - to say/express one’s thought

No matter how mundane some action might appear, keep at it long enough and it becomes a contemplative, even meditative act.
- mundane
  - ordinary, boring
  - concerned with ordinary daily life
- keep at it / keep it up
  - to continue to do something
- something keeps up
  - it continues
- contemplative
  - spending a lot of time thinking seriously and quietly

It just goes to show how grueling an event a marathon really is.
- grueling
  - very difficult and tiring

Though I wouldn’t call any of this philosophy per se, this book does contain a certain amount of what might be dubbed life lessons.
- per se /ˌpɜː ˈseɪ $ ˌpɜːr ˈsiː, -ˈseɪ, ˌper ˈseɪ/
  - used to say that something is being considered alone, not with other connected things
- dub
  - to give something or someone a name that describes them in some way
  - to change the original spoken language of a film (be dubbed into)

## One

I spend a lot of time in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and compared to Cambridge -so muggy and hot with all its bricks and concrete it’s like a form of torture- summer in Hawaii is a veritable paradise.
- muggy
  - unpleasantly warm and damp
- veritable
  - real, true (emphasizing)

How happy life is here, where we can enjoy lounging around, reading a book in the shade of trees, or, if the notion strikes us, go down, just as we are, for a dip in the inlet.

Sometimes I run fast when I feel like it, but if I increase the pace I shorten the amount of time I run, the point being to let the exhilaration I feel at the end of each run carry over to the next day.
- exhilaration
  - a feeling of being happy, excited, and full of energy
- carry (something) over
  - to continue something in the new situation or later

    - She slumped against the wall

Sometimes when I think of life, I feel like a piece of driftwood washed up on shore.

As I run, the trade winds blowing in from the direction of the lighthouse rustle the leaves of the eucalyptus over my head.

I began living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the end of May of this year, and running has once again been the mainstay of my daily routine ever since.

It would be better if I ran seven days, but I have to factor in rainy days, and days when work keeps me busy.
- factor something in
  - to include some particular thing in your calculation
Taking all this into account, I leave one day a week as a day off.

In June I followed this plan exactly, running 156 miles on the nose.

The running part isn’t a problem for me, but in order to master the other two legs of the event I had to devote a great deal of time to training in swimming and biking.

All of this took time and effort, and as a result I had less time to devote to running.
The thing is, I’m not much for team sports.
And when it comes to martial arts, too, you can count me out.

World-class runners, of course, want to outdo their closest rivals, but for your average, everyday runner, individual rivalry isn’t a major issue.
- outdo someone in something
  - to be better

I’m sure there are garden-variety runners whose desire to beat a particular rival spurs them on to train harder.
- garden-variety
  - very ordinary
- spur somebody (on) to do something / spur somebody (on) to something
  - to encourage
- spur
  - a fact or event that makes you try harder to do something

But what happens if their rival, for whatever reason, drops out of the competition?
Most ordinary runners are motivated by an individual goal, more than anything: namely, a time thy want to beat.
- namely
  - to be specific / its name is … / their names are …

As long as he can beat that time, a runner will feel he’s accomplished what he set out to do, and if he can’t then he’ll feel he hasn’t.
- set out for/on somewhere
  - to start a journey (syn. set off)
- set out to do something / set out with the idea/purpose/intention
  - to start doing something, making plans, setting goals, etc

  - to explain, to arrange, …

Maybe numbers of copies sold, awards won, and critics’ praise serve as outward standards for accomplishment in literature, but none of them really matter.

I’m at an ordinary- or perhaps more like mediocre- level.
- mediocre
  - not very good
There are individual differences, but for the most part swimmers hit that watershed in their early twenties, boxers in their late twenties, and baseball players in their mid-thirties.
- watershed
  - turning point
Once I asked an ophthalmologist if anyone’s ever avoided getting farsighted when they got older.

Things continued at the stable plateau for a while, but before long they started to change.
But no matter how much I might deny it or try to ignore it, the numbers were retreating, step by step.
- retreat
  - to move away from the enemy after being defeated in battle (opp. advance)
- move back / change one’s mind
Just running all the time couldn’t be good for me, I’d figured, deciding it would be better to add variety to my routine and develop a more all-around physical regimen.
- regimen
  - a special plan for food, exercise etc that is intended to improve your health (syn. regime)
A sense of disappointment set in that all my hard work wasn’t paying off, that there was something obstructing me, like a door that was usually open suddenly slammed in my face.

- obstruct
  - to block a road, passage etc
  - to prevent someone from doing something or something from happening
When I saw the Charles River again, a desire to run swept over me.

The water soaks the shoreline, making the summer grass think, which help feed the waterfowl, and it flows languidly, ceaselessly, under the old bridges, reflecting clouds in summer and bobbing with floes in winter- and silently heads toward the ocean.

Breathing in the crisp, bracing, early-morning air, I felt once again the joy of running on the familiar ground.

The problem is, it’s also used by cyclists, so you have to watch out for speeding bikes whizzing past from behind.

Sometimes when I run, I listen to jazz, but usually, it’s rock, since its beat is the best accompaniment to the rhythm of running.
- accompaniment

In two and a half months I dropped about seven pounds, and the bit of flab I was starting to see around my stomach disappeared.
- flab
  - soft loose flesh on a person’s body - used to show disapproval
I had mixed emotions about carrying around that extra weight with me everyday.
But I discovered to my delight that even these indulgences can be offset by persistent exercise.
- to someone’s delight
  - casing someone to be very happy
  - happily
- indulgence
  - the habit of allowing yourself to do or have whatever you want, or allowing someone else to do/have so

It might be a little silly for someone getting to be my age to put this into words, but I just want to make sure I get the facts down clearly: I’m the kind of person who likes to be by himself.
- put something into words
  - to explain a feeling that you are having
- get the facts down?
- get down to the facts
  - to focus on the most important or truthful aspects of a particular situation

Gradually, then, though with my own spin on it, through personal experience I discovered how to be sociable.
- one’s own spin on it (usually in a form of ’to put someone’s (own) spin on it)
  - in this context, my own spin on it = my own interpretation of it
All I need to do is gaze at the scenery passing by.
- gaze into/at/… 
  - to look at someone or something for a long time, giving it all your attention, often without realizing you are doing so
  - syn. stare at (usually with some kind of emotion)
