# What's the difference between 'object' and 'instance'?

In most practical cases, they are interchangeable. However, there is a notable theoretical difference.

Let's say it figuratively. A *class* is a blueprint. *Objects* are built based on the blueprint. Finally, each *object* is an *instance*.

We would consider the term '*object*' to be more collective. By contrast, '*instance*' is more individual.

I'd mostly use '*instance*' in practice because it feels more practical and less conceptual to me. :-)
