# OOP Basic Concepts

## Abstraction & Encapsulation

*Abstraction* is a process of hiding the complexity and providing only the functionalities.

*Encapsulation* is a mechanism of wrapping the data and the behaviors in a single unit such as a class. It also refers to hiding the unnecessary data or behaviors from users.

### Comparison
  * Abstraction
    * more conceptual
    * more about design
  * Encapsulation
    * more practical
    * more about implementation

## Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism by which an object (or class) acquires the some/all properties of another object (or class).

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism is a process of behaving differently based on context or meaning.

The famous examples are Method Overloading and Method Overriding. Note that Method Overloading is static and in-class, whereas Method Overriding is dynamic and inter-class.
